# Bun 1.0 + Astro 3.0 

Astro supports Bun out of the box, Nuxt does, Next and Remix don't yet. Let's give it try.

It is fast(I eyeballed it ðŸ˜Ž), I like it already. Let me find a good project idea to make it better.

Okay, I've played it for a couple of hours, installed and uninstalled packages using `bunx`, it is notably faster than node, the hot-reloading feels instant. 

It's like what the doc says, fully compatible with node. For example, I installed shadcnUI with `bunx`, it worked out fine.
